## About Me

Hello! I am Jiayi Lu (he/his), a second-year PhD student in linguistics at Stanford University. Before coming to Stanford, I completed my BA at Northwestern University with majors in linguistics, neuroscience, and integrated science.

## Research
I am primarily interested in syntax and psycholinguistics. 

### Syntax
In the domain of syntax, I'm generally interested in island effects. Specifically, I have looked at the coordinate structure constraint (the islandhood of conjuncts), and the argument/adjunct asymmetry in island effects. 

(1) Coordinate structure constraint and the syntax of coordination:

(2) Argument/adjunct asymmetry in island-sensitivity:

### Psycholinguistics
In the domain of psycholinguistics, I'm particularly interested in the nature of acceptability judgments (i.e. what do participants do when they give acceptability ratings to sentences?). I have also done some work on the noisy-channel model of sentence comprehension, and the processing of relative clauses.  

(1) Satiation of acceptability judgment:

(2) Processing of syntactically "noisy" sentences in Mandarin Chinese (work done at TedLab at MIT):

(3) Processing of Chinese relative clauses (work done in the Aphasia and Neurolinguistic Lab at Northwestern University):

## Me not as a Linguist
In my free time, I enjoy cooking, traveling, playing soccer, and watching movies. I'm also a collector of stamps, covers, and other ephemera. As a member of the American First Day Cover Society, I also create cachets (artworks on the left side of stamped covers) for first day covers. Here are some FDC cachets I created:

[cachet for Scott #5557 "Chien-Shiung Wu Forever stamp"](https://github.com/lu-jiayi/homepage/raw/master/wucs_cover.pdf)

[cachet fot Scott #5556 "Year of the Ox Forever stamp"](https://github.com/lu-jiayi/homepage/raw/master/yox_cover.pdf)
