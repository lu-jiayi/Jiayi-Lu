## About Me

Hello! I am a second-year PhD student in linguistics at Stanford University. I am mostly interested in syntax and psycholinguistics. 

## Research
### Syntax
In the domain of syntax, I'm generally interested in Island effects. Specifically, I have looked at the coordinate structure constraint (the islandhood of conjuncts), and the argument/adjunct asymmetry in island effects. 

(1) Coordinate structure constraint and the syntax of coordination:

(2) Argument/adjunct asymmetry in island-sensitivity:

### Psycholinguistics
In the domain of psycholinguistics, I'm particularly interested in the nature of acceptability judgments (i.e. what do participants do when they give acceptability ratings to sentences?). I have also done some work on the noisy-channel model of sentence comprehension, and the processing of relative clauses.  

(1) Satiation of acceptability judgment:

(2) Processing of syntactically "noisy" sentences in Mandarin Chinese (work done at TedLab at MIT):

(3) Processing of Chinese relative clauses (work done in the Aphasia and Neurolinguistic Lab at Northwestern University):
