## About Me

Hello! I am Jiayi Lu (陆家屹，he/his), a fourth-year PhD student in linguistics at Stanford University. I completed my BA at Northwestern University in 2019 with majors in linguistics, neuroscience, and integrated science. I'm originally from Beijing, China.

## Research Interests
I am primarily interested in syntax and psycholinguistics. 

In the domain of syntax, I'm generally interested in island effects. Specifically, I have looked at the coordinate structure constraint (the islandhood of conjuncts), and the argument/adjunct asymmetry in island effects. I am also interested in the structure of clause chaining and coordination.

In the domain of psycholinguistics, I'm interested in the nature of acceptability judgments (i.e. what do participants do when they give acceptability ratings to sentences? What makes a sentence (un)acceptable? When do accepatbility ratings change and why?). I have also done some work on the noisy-channel model of sentence comprehension, and the processing of relative clauses.

## Me not as a Linguist
In my free time, I enjoy cooking, traveling, and watching movies. I'm also a collector of stamps, covers, and other ephemera. As a member of the American First Day Cover Society, I also create cachets (artworks on the left side of stamped covers) for first day covers. [Here](https://github.com/lu-jiayi/homepage/raw/master/wucs_cover.pdf) and [here](https://github.com/lu-jiayi/homepage/raw/master/yox_cover.pdf) are some example covers I helped with creating. I also love sending and receiving postcards: here is a [website](https://www.postcrossing.com/) that I use to exchange postcards with my fellow postal enthusiasts around the globe.    

I also love playing and watching soccer. I am a licensed youth soccer coach (USSF E license), and I once coached the U13/14 girls team at Jahbat FC (a travel team based in Evanston, IL.) for two seasons from 2016 to 2017. [Here](https://github.com/lu-jiayi/homepage/raw/master/unnamed.jpg) is a picture of me with the team!
