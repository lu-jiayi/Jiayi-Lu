## About Me

Hello! I am a second-year PhD student in linguistics at Stanford University. I am mostly interested in syntax and psycholinguistics. 

## Recent/On-going Research Projects
### Syntax and Processing of Island Constructions

(1) Argument/adjunct asymmetry in island-sensitivity: [case study in Chinese](https://doi.org/10.1162/ling_a_00343), [amlap2018 poster](https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/sites.northwestern.edu/dist/8/1599/files/2017/01/AMLaP2018-v1-1v3qtms.pdf), [Extension to multiple-wh questions](https://github.com/lu-jiayi/Jiayi-Lu/blob/master/Thesis_Submit.pdf)

(2) Coordinate structure constraint and the syntax of coordination

(3) Satiation of acceptability judgment (github repos: [1](https://github.com/lu-jiayi/Satiation_baseline), [2](https://github.com/lu-jiayi/satiation_exp1b_island_as_ungram), [3](https://github.com/lu-jiayi/satiation_exp1c_island_as_neutral))

### Sentence Processing in General

(1) Processing of syntactically "noisy" sentences in Mandarin Chinese (manuscript in prep, with Meilin Zhan, Ted Gibson, and Roger Levy)

(2) Processing of Chinese relative clauses (work done in the Aphasia and Neurolinguistic Lab at Northerstern: [poster at SNL2018](https://github.com/lu-jiayi/Jiayi-Lu/blob/master/final-Chinese-Sentence-Processing_SNL2018_JL_MW_CT-V2-25lkw4h.pdf))
